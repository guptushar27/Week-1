            "Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It involves designing algorithms that can identify patterns, make decisions, and adapt to new data over time. By analyzing historical data, these models can make accurate predictions or automate decision-making tasks. Machine Learning is widely used in various domains, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and robotics.\n",
            "What is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm?\n",
            "A supervised machine learning algorithm is one that learns from labeled datasets, meaning each training example is paired with an output label. The model's objective is to learn a mapping from input features to the correct output label, allowing it to make accurate predictions on unseen data. The learning process involves minimizing the error between the predicted and actual outputs. Supervised learning is particularly effective for problems where historical data contains clear, defined outcomes.\n",
